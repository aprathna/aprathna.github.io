In learning about user experience and what really works best, we decided to take what we already knew was good from popular pre-exitsing music steaming mobile apps, Spotify and Soundcloud, and design an app that could put all of those together. Hence, Soundify.</h3>

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Going about creating this protoype was a highly iterative process, wherein our team had to juggle back and forth with many of the decisions we decided to make. Here I will outline the procress from our sketches to our prototype, and how we came to the decisions that we did. </h3>

                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Soundify3.png" >
            </br>
                <p>We can start with the sketches. The image above shows the our first mockups for the design of our app, outlining the process of creating a playlist. We knew that there we parts of each app that we wanted to use, including the general homepage format that Spotify provides, and the playlist format that SoundCloud has. We took into consideration that the app was to be used on a mobile phone, where people would be on the go and doing other things. We wanted something that would give large, salient buttons and easy functionality while keeping to a minimalist and clean design.

            </br>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Soundify4.png" alt="">
            </br>
                <p>The image above details one of the examples of redesign we used to simplify a basic function: deleting songs out of a playlist. On the left is our Soundify's option, and on the middle and right are Spotify. The series of steps to even get to the delete option is Spotify is longer and more convoluted than is necessary, and once the user has gotten there they are only able to delete one song at a time. We instead took inspiration from iMessage, and had the delete function on Soundify allow the user to delete multiple at a time with little hassel, prompting the user before the deletion is made to ensure they do not accidently get rid of songs.  </p>
            </br>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Soundify6.png" alt="">
            </br>
                <p>The playlists are displayed in a grid format for easier visibility and tapping, two album covers to a row, a format we took from SoundCloud. For each individual playlist, in addition to just the image, playlist name, and creator, we also decided to show the number of tracks within the playlist (displayed in the corner of the album cover) and its privacy (indicated by a small lock next to the creator label). We tried to display these in the least intrusive way possible, as to reduce the amount of clutter on the page while still allowing quick access to the information it affords.

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"> While the app is only a high fidelity protoype that follows a couple user scenarios, we tried our best to create it in a way that would seem as nearly believeable as a real app to the user. We tested it on on several friends, having them walk through the scenarios they gave us, and editing along the way when anyone ran into a problem. The result is a clean, straightforward version of our favorite music apps all in one. Our hope is that one day, we can build an app like this for real with access to the music on a scale that would really be useful.   </h3>
